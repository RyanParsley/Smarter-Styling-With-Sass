# A presentation about Sass
The simplicity of CSS is one of it&rsquo;s greatest strengths, but sometimes you want more elegant solutions. That&rsquo;s where Sass comes in. Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. I&rsquo;ll show you how Sass can help you write better, more bullet resistant, and easier to maintain style sheets. I&rsquo;ll also share how Sass has helped me solve real world challenges such as creating responsive layouts.
